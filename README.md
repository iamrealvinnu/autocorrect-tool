# Auto Correct Tool

A Python-based text correction tool with GUI interface that uses the T5 transformer model for grammar correction. This tool helps users correct grammar and spelling mistakes in real-time using advanced machine learning.

## Features
- Real-time text correction using T5 transformer model
- User-friendly GUI interface built with tkinter
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Clear text option
- Proper sentence capitalization
- Error handling and user feedback
- Multi-sentence support

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- happytransformer
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamrealvinnu/autocorrect-tool.git
cd autocorrect-tool
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install happytransformer
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
```bash
python autoCorrect_tool.py
```

2. Using the tool:
   - Enter or paste your text in the top text area
   - Click "Correct Text" to process
   - The corrected version will appear in the bottom text area
   - Use "Copy Corrected Text" to copy to clipboard
   - "Clear Text" removes all content from both areas

## How It Works

The tool uses the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model specifically trained for grammar correction. It:
1. Processes input text through the model
2. Applies proper capitalization
3. Handles multiple sentences appropriately
4. Provides immediate feedback for any errors
